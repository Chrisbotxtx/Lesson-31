                <b class="text-primary">Codingal </b> is on a mission to inspire school kids to <b class="text-warning">fall in love
                    with coding</b>. Coding helps develop logical thinking and
            
                problem-solving skills. Coding jobs are the future. They already constitute more than 60% of all the
            
                jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. While still in school, those who start young
            
                will be ahead of everyone by the time they get into college. They will be <b class="text-danger">creators of the
                    future</b>.

                In todayâ€™s age, <b class="text-warning">coding </b>has become an essential skill. Coding for kids
            
                helps them interact with technology better. Studies also show that it aids in holistic development
            
                of the child, improving cognitive functioning as well as logical thinking.
            
                <b class="text-info">Holistic development </b> means evolving cognitive, physical, and social
            
                skills of a child to prepare them better for the interactions with the world. Coding as an activity
            
                not only involves mental development but also focuses on social understanding.
